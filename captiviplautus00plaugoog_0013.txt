puts Tyndarus to work in the stone quarries as a pun-
ishment. In due time Philocrates returns, bringing
Philopolemus and with him Stalagmus. The latter re-
veals the identity of Tyndarus and Paegnium, who is
then brought out of the quarries and recognized astho
long-lost son of Hegio. Stalagmus is given over to pun-
ishment, and the story ends happily. The play is enliv-
ened by the character of Ergasilus, a parasite. ’

The moral tone of the piece is above the standard of
its day. The eminent Plautine critic of the sixteenth
century, Camerarius, called the “ Captives '³ the best of the
Plautine plays and Lessing, in his “ Criticism of the Gap
tives of Plautus,’' says: “The ‘Captivos’ is the finest
play ever put upon the stage. The sole reason of this
is that it most nearly answers the purpose of comedy,
and besides is richiy embellished with other occidental
beauties.'' However, critice of the present day do not ' ⁵

place so high an estimate upon the play.
