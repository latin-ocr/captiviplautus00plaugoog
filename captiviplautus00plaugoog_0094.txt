This Series contains the Latin authors usually read in American
schools and colleges, and also others well adapted to class-rcum
use, but not heretoiore published in suitable editions. The several
volumes are prepared by special editore, who aim to revise the
text careiully and ιο edit it in the most serviceable manner.
Wherc there are German editions oi unusual merit, representing
years oi special study under the most favorable circumstances,

these are used, with the consent ci the foreign editor, as a basis
ior the American edition. In this way it is possible ιο bring out
text-books oi the highest excellence in a comparatively short period
oitimc.

The editions arc oi two kinds, conforming to the different
methods oi studying Latin in our best institutions. Some contain
in the introductione and commentary such a careiul and minute
treatment ol the author’s lite, language, and style as to aiiord the
means ior a thorough appreciation oi the author and his place in
Latin literature. Others aim merely to assist the student to a good
reading knowledge oi the author, and have only the text and briei
explanatory notes at the bottom oi each page. The latter are
particularly acceptable ior sight reading, audior rapid reading
aiter the minute study ol an author or period in one oi · the fuller
editions. For instance, aiter a class has read a play or two oi
Plautus and Terence careiully, with special reference to the pecu-
liarities of style, language, matres, the methcds oi presentiuga
play, and the like, these editions will he admirably suited for the
rapid reading oi other plays.

The Series also contains various supplementary works prepared
by competent scholars. livery effort is made ιο give the books a
neat and attractiva appearance.
